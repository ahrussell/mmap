mmap
====

Sage (6.4.1 and later) implementation of the GGH and CLT multilinear map scheme.  Partial implementation of a semantically-secure order-revealing encryption scheme.

A lattice-based attack on CLT has been included, but this is not the most recent nor most devastating attack on CLT (which has yet to recover from the most recent attack).

Work on the graph-induced multilinear map scheme is in progress.
