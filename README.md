Sage (6.4.1 and later) implementation of the [GGH](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/610.pdf) and [CLT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/183.pdf) multilinear map scheme.  Partial implementation of a semantically-secure order-revealing encryption scheme.

A lattice-based attack on CLT has been included, but this is not the most recent nor most devastating attack on CLT (which has yet to recover from the most recent [attack](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/929.pdf)).

Work on the [graph-induced multilinear map](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/645.pdf) scheme is in progress.
